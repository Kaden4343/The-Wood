## Using TEI on Oxygen
#### By Kaden Woodward

#### *Coding Background*

My coding background consists of absolutely nothing. I have never been a technological savvy person, so I have had no interest in learning how to code. The closest thing to coding I have done is probably with my data analytics class using the Tableau software. So as you could imagine my first reaction to a project on straight coding was "oh my god". So here begins my journey with TEI, Oxygen, coding and all of that.

#### *The Project*

In this project we were tasked with coding sections of “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charolette Perkins Stetson. The method of coding included using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) with Oxygen, which uses eXtensible Markup Language known as XML. 
I was assigned pages 44-47 which included quite a bit of things that needed to be marked up and coded. The first step of the project was to first use a google doc transcription of the text provided by the professor, and then from there I had to markup the text to prepare to put it into code. Once I found all of the things needed to markup, I went into Oxygen and coded the pages line by line.

#### *Marking Up the text*

Marking up the text for me consisted of annotating the pages and looking for things like weird spaces, em dashes, paragraph starts, page breaks, and strikethroughs. There are many more markups available, but those are the main ones seen in the text I was assigned. I personally felt like my pages had a good number of markups and a good amount of different ones. 

I felt that this was better for me in the end because it gave me more practice with different markups which will prepare me more for any coding in the future. Having the text we needed in the google doc was also a huge help from the jump because of how it was laid out made it easier to spot those things. I annotated all of the markups I found by using the comments on the side, so it made it easy to keep track of all the different things needed to code.


#### *Oxygen and XML*

With the first step done I felt as if the project was not nearly as bad as I expected it to be. Then I opened up Oxygen and saw the format everything was in and I immediately thought back to my initial view, “oh my god.” The initial manuscript could have been chinese for all I knew, as I have never seen or done anything with coding.

The only things I could think about were the XML tags that the professor gave us in the prompt, and I knew that they correlated to the markups I made in the google doc. So the next thing was to put them in code along with the rest of the text.

Having the professor walk us through some of the steps and explain the format in detail helped tremendously. If she wouldn’t have done that I don’t think I would have been able to even start. Using her guidance and a little surface research online I was able to start putting the code in slowly. Once I had a couple lines of code in and used most of the XML tags once, I started to get in a real groove. I feel like this is one of those things that has a learning curve that once you get over that hump then you’re golden. Once I got over the hump I felt like a pro at it as I flew through the rest of the lines of coding.

My whole thought process about coding from before and after the project was like a day and night difference. I have not had any coding experience before, so I immediately panicked and just thought the worst was going to happen. Once I got in the groove of the coding I actually enjoyed it a lot because I felt like I was good at it and it came easy. I definitely am looking forward to more opportunities like this where I get to expand my technological and coding skills
