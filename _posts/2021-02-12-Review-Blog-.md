  Placing Segregation is an interactive map of population and segregation variants across three cities in 1860, Washington D.C., Omaha, & Tennessee. The map incorporates three different demographic, geographic, and social locations to show the true variety of how segregation played a role in the development of cities.The choosing of the cities also showed that segregation was not a random or rare thing. The different filters of segregation in the maps include skin color, occupation, nationality and wealth. A common misconception about segregation, in this time period specifically, was that the only people that were seen as segregated were people of different color than the “average American”. Although race was the biggest factor of segregation in most of the country, economic status, nationality, and occupation were other prevalent factors that segregated people into certain locations.

  The project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions. It seems as geocoding and geolocating technologies were predominantly used for the mapping and placing of the data into points and the single layer on the map. From there the data layers were stored as text based files called GeoJSON files. These files communicate with browsers to indicate if the data is a point, line, or areas of coordinates. The website also explains that anybody can copy and edit any of the text files on their own and do whatever they want with them. That gives people the opportunity to follow off this project and possibly expand it or enhance it.


  This project does a great job of incorporating written records and historical maps into complex, interactive maps with massive detail. Not only does it have filters to map out the segregation, it also has the ability to click on each single point to bring up detailed information such as gender, race, income, and occupation through census records from the time period. Each point on the map is also tied to real estate records to show values of homes. By using the specific street addresses for homes and the integrating of modern maps, it also allows the viewer to see the contrast between the street grids of old and new. Something like that could not have been available until at the least 10 years ago, due to technological limitations. The project has definitely made an effort to make the interface as user friendly as possible with different view modes of each map, accessible filters, and search bars. 



  The main participants of this project all came from the University of Iowa. Dr. Sheard,the director of the project, is a population geographer who also is the Geographic Informations Systems Specialistat the Digital Scholarship and Publishing Studio at the university. Annie Klusak, Justin Baumgartner, and Greg Mckee are all transcription assistants on the project with all of them working in digital projects and arts. The whole team has a collection of experience and knowledge in the digital and arts fields, and they have tied it all together with digital humanities on this project.

 

  Placing Segregation really did a great job of displaying these historical records and maps in a way that could not have been done before modern times. Of course everybody knew about segregation throughout U.S history, but to the extent of what this project shows us, I don’t think many people would have known. This is one of the few projects that put together different classes of segregation all in the same interface and map.This project leaves the viewer wanting to look into it more by the use of many different filters on each map. From there, with each filter you want to click on the dots to look more into the disparity between different races, nationalities, and occupational classes. When I first went through the maps I had no idea that you could click on each point and find out about the individual house incomes, ethnicities, nationalities, genders, etc. So, I think that is something they should put on a side note or pop up window beside each map to let the viewer know they can do that. The site does have it in the “About” section which is easy to read and easy to find. I just think it would be more user friendly if they could see a note about it while looking at the maps considering that is the first thing you see when you open up the project site. Given this information, I think they did a great job of capturing an old world issue that we still see in modern times. Segregation is not just what we think of with African Americans being segregated for years, it is prevalent in cities and communities heavily today without being acknowledged or cared about.
