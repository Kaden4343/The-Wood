**Summary:**

This project is an interactive map that shows some of the effects from climate change within the next 60 years. The map includes 540 North American cities from the United States and Canada to show what their climate might look like in 2080. The map has some filters you can use which include different emission expectations, average vs. individual forecasts, and different comparisons of the relationship between climates.

**Design:**

The foundation of the project was built using Climate-analog mapping, which is “a statistical technique that quantifies the similarity of a location’s climate relative to the climate of another place and/or time.”(Hallegatte & Ambrosi). To find more in detail numbers on temperature and precipitation they used R Studio and custom R Scripts to get local weather station data for each urban area. The rest of the design came from using probability equations and standard deviations to find different scenarios.



**Relevance:**

This project would not have been very relevant 10-15 years ago because people were not really thinking about climate change and the effects we had on the environment. This project also probably would not have been possible 10 years ago due to technology limitations This project’s relevance to humanities is immeasurable because the planet is on the verge of catastrophe and humanity as a whole needs to act now or things could get as bad as the map indicates.

This project is a great way to reach the younger, more tech savvy generations by bringing important climate information to an interactive setting with a nice layout. The study behind the project incorporated so much data and different forecasts from scientific studies into one interactive map and I think it is really impressive. The interactive map serves as a warning or even a call to action to those that have viewed it. The fact that the climate of Richmond is supposed to feel like Southern Texas in 60 years is very alarming.

I love the subject of this topic because I think more people need to realize what we are doing to the planet and how it will look in the future. I think that the directors of the project and study used this to educate the general public on the subject of climate change. This project deserves more recognition due to its significance.

**Findings:**

The project overall was really interesting and informative, but could have been formatted better. I think the front page of the project could have incorporated a cover page that outlined the project. The only way to get a grasp of the project is to click the learn more tab which gave you a brief overview of it. 

From there you could click another link that sent you to an article about the study conducted that was behind the project. This page gives you the most background information about the project, but the problem is that you have to click two separate links to get to it. They should have incorporated the article in a tab labeled “about” or something like that. The brief summary could have been a tab labeled “Summary” or “overview” to make it easier to get a quick gist of the project. If you click the “learn more” then the “how to” sections it gives you a great understanding of how to use all of the features which is great, but I think that should be more readily accessible.

The filters of the map are well placed and easily recognizable, but I feel as though some of them could have been better explained as two are pretty confusing. You do have to do some digging to find better explanations of the filters.  I love the filter of the average forecasts vs. the average and individual because it gives you an idea of the variety of predictions and lets you form your own predictions somewhat. 

The filter of the reduced emissions vs. continued emissions gives you a negative and positive by showing you what things could be like if we started improving society environmentally which gives the project more of an overall positive vibe. Instead of just saying this is what it will look like in 60 years, it gives you a positive outlook so you’re not super stressed about it like me. Overall the project was great but could use basic design changes that would make it more accessible and polished.

The project was headed by Matthew R. Fitzpatrick & Robert R. Dunn. Fitzpatrick did most of the analyses, calculations, and designing. Robert Dunn co designed the project while doing most of the writing and manuscript editing. Funding came from the University of Maryland Centre for Environmental Science.
